# Follow Up

Given more time I would add more styling throughout the application. I would make sure that infomration is more properly spaced and optimized for differenty platforms. I would also try to make the images work with either the node package i used for the Homes Page (AgGrid), find a new package, or just make my own table that I could style in a simliar fashion. 

Furthermore I would spend more time designing elegant error handling incase the website we are consuming is down. While the current solution prevents crashes, it could be more usefriendly. 

For the average price of houses per community, I would also change it into some sort of chart as opposed to a graph. Once again, making the information easier to absorb and user friendly.

Also for the background, I would only cycle out the images so that they would be darker. This would make sure that the text is always readable as sometimes with a bright background it is hard to read.
